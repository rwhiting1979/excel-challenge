# Crowdfunding Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes crowdfunding campaign data to understand success factors, funding goals, and backer behavior using Microsoft Excel. The data contains campaign outcomes, funding goals, and launch dates.

## Analysis Steps
Data Preparation:

* Split "Category" and "Sub-Category" into separate columns.
*Convert Unix timestamps in "Launched_at" to Excel's date format.

## Goal Analysis:

* Categorize goals into ranges (e.g., "<1000," "1000-4999").
* Use COUNTIFS() to count campaigns by goal and outcome.
* Calculate percentages of success, failure, or cancellation per goal range.

## Visualization:

* Create a line chart to visualize goal success relationships.

## Statistical Analysis:

Analyze backer statistics for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

## Conclusions
* Success rates vary by category.
* Lower goals tend to result in higher success rates.
* Backer counts differ significantly among successful campaigns.

## Limitations
* Data may be incomplete.
* Historical trends are unavailable.
* Limited dataset features for in-depth analysis.
